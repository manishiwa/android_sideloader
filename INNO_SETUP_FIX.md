# Inno Setup Fix Validation

This documents the fix for the Inno Setup compilation issue.

## Problem
The GitHub workflow was failing with "The system cannot find the path specified" when trying to compile the Windows installer using Inno Setup.

## Root Cause
The issue was with third-party GitHub Actions for Inno Setup (specifically `Minionguyjpro/Inno-Setup-Action@v1.2.5`), not with the installer.iss file itself.

## Solution
Replaced the third-party action with manual installation and execution:

1. Downloads Inno Setup 6.2.2 directly from the official source
2. Installs it silently on the GitHub runner
3. Detects the installation path dynamically
4. Runs ISCC.exe directly with full error reporting

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`: Replaced Inno Setup action with manual installation
- `installer.iss`: No changes needed - the file was correct

## Expected Result
The workflow should now successfully:
1. Build the Flutter Windows application
2. Install Inno Setup
3. Compile the installer.iss into AndroidSideloader-{version}-Windows-Installer.exe
4. Upload the installer as an artifact

## Next Steps
Once verified working, the debugging output can be reduced for cleaner logs.
